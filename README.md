## 1. Introduction

This Hub will showcase projects and frameworks from the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem) that are related to data visualization.

Beyond the repositories from Topic 2, I will now use this space to share new ideas, research sub-modules, and even games that I created. I found these particularly apt for illustrating the representations and implications I aim to explore.

## 2. Attention-Head HeatMap Visualizers  
**Status: Active**

### 2.1 [llm-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/llm-heatmap-visualizer)

### 2.2 [saliency-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/saliency-heatmap-visualizer)

- Visualizes decision-making processes within the model
- Helps identify bias patterns and reasoning paths
- Supports transparent AI development

## 3. Research Submodules

I will expand on each sub-module in a specific folder and document it there.
